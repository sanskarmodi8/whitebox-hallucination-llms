# White-Box Hallucination in Large Language Models

This repository contains code and experiments for an undergraduate research project
studying hallucination behavior in large language models through controllable
training-time and inference-time hyperparameters.

## Scope
- Hallucination analysis and categorization
- Inference-time decoding controls
- PEFT-based fine-tuning (LoRA)
- Empirical evaluation and trade-off analysis

## Status
Work in progress.
